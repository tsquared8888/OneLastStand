# OneLastStand

This is a simple three button game I created for a challenge.<br>
To view the scripts, go to "Assets/Scripts". If you want to<br>
play the final version, please go to:<br>

If you want to open the game in Unity, you will have to create
a new project with version 2020.3.36f1 and add the assets in<br>
the asset folder.
